Hi! I'm rein.
<br>I make a lot of things, so let's go one by one or go to a specific part on the left.
<h1 id="minecraft">
Minecraft
</h1>
So, Minecraft. I can give a few links such as my <a href="https://youtube.com/@tgrein">youtube channel</a>, and <a href="https://facebook.com/tgreinfb">facebook page</a>. I do have more socials which can be seen <a href="https://linktr.ee/tgrein">here</a>, but they don't really matter.

How about what I did in Minecraft? I was in a very small SMP called Draconix, did too many livestreams to count, and had a good time.

Cubing

Did you know I also solve some puzzles? Here, let me show you.
